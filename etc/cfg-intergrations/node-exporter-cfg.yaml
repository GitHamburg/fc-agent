# The `node_exporter_config` block configures the `node_exporter` integration,

# [`node_exporter`](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter)
# and allows for collecting metrics from the UNIX system that `node_exporter` is
# running on. It provides a significant amount of collectors that are responsible
# for monitoring various aspects of the host system.
